# Cryptocurrencies by Ketaki
## Overview 
This project creates a report to include the cryptocurrencies that are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for new investment.
This is done using Pandas, Plotly Express and Unsupervised machine learning to preprocess and transform the data and create data visualizations.
## Results
The data was pre-processed to drop unwanted data columns and null values using Pandas, reduce the data to include fewer dimensions using Principal Component Analysis(PCA), then passed onto Clustering Algorithms such as K-means algorithms to create visualizations.

## Summary
- The Cyptocurrency data was grouped into different clusters using Unsupervised learning Clustering algorithm and visualizations were created using the Plotly Express functions.
- We find that, based on the given data, there were four clusters or groups into which the Cryptocurrency data can be divided.
