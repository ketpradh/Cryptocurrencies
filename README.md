# Cryptocurrencies by Ketaki
## Overview 
This project creates a report to include the cryptocurrencies that are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for new investment.
This is done using Pandas, Plotly Express and Unsupervised machine learning to preprocess and transfirm the data and create data visualizations.
## Results
The data was pre-processed to drop unwanted data columns and null values to create the following visualizations:

1. Elbow Curve

3. Scatter Plot

## Summary
The Cyptocurrency data was grouped into different clusters using Unsupervised learning algorithms and visualizations were created using the Plotly Express functions.
We find that theere were four clusters or groups into which the data can be divided.
